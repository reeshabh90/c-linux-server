# Client Server program in C
## Operating System : Linux

This is a sample project where I am trying to learn how to create Server and Client in Inter Process Communication on same machine 
and Network Communication on two physical machines.

Server maintains client connection using File Descriptors. File descriptors are integers that uniquely identify open files within a process. When a file is opened, the operating system assigns a non-negative integer to represent that file within the context of the process.
