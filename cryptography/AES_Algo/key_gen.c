 * ‚ÑπÔ∏è This program generates a 128-bit (16 bytes) key
 * 1. The program relies on OpenSSL‚Äôs crypto library's RAND_bytes() function.
 * 2. The functions in the OpenSSL‚Äôs crypto library aren't automatically included by default.
 *    They are external, meaning they are not built into the compiler or executable
 * Note: Execute the program by linking to OpenSSL's crypto library, which has to be pre-installed.
 * Command: gcc -o key_gen key_gen.c -lcrypto 
 * Here, `-lcrypto` flag allows the program to call OpenSSL functions at runtime.
 * Installation: sudo apt install libssl-dev
