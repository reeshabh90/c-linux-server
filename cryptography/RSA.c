 * ‚ÑπÔ∏è This program implements RSA algorithm.
 *
 * 1. The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer.
 * 2. Choose two large primes `p` and `q`
 * 3. Compute `n = p √ó q`; This will be half of the public key.
 * 4. Compute `œÜ(n) = (p‚àí1)(q‚àí1)`
 * 5. Select `e` such that `1 < e < œÜ(n)` and `gcd(e, œÜ(n)) = 1`.
 *    In practice, `e` is often chosen to be (2^16+1)=65537, though it can be as small as 33 in some cases.
 *    `e` will be the other half of the public key.
 * 6. Calculate  modular inverse `d` such that `d √ó e ‚â° 1 mod œÜ(n)`. In other words, d is the private key.
 * 7. Note: RSA Algorithm takes the value of p and q to be very large which in turn makes the value of n extremely large
 *    and factorizing such a large value is computationally impossible. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long.
 *
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Threat: Quantum algorithms, for instance Shor's algorithm, can quickly factor large numbers,
 *   thus making RSA obsolete. Against traditional attacks, with large keys (2048 bit or more) RSA is secure.
 *   However, advancement in computing powers may prove to be a challenge to RSA's reliability in the future.
 *
 * ü´µ To handle this potential risk, post-quantum cryptography, like lattice-based encryption is currently being explored
 *    as a solution to ensure data security in a world where RSA is breakable.
